The Following files will be there with the tar of the Driver:

	mcs9865.c
	mcs9865.h
	mcs9865-isa.c
	mcs9865-isa.h
	Makefile
	README	
	mcs9865

Building the Driver:
--------------------
  Change to the folder with the Starex source files. And run the following Command:
	$ make

  Once the driver is compliles the loadable module mcs9865.ko will be created in the same folder.

To build driver on kernels from v2.6.34 till latest:
----------------------------------------------------
  Since the device ID 9865 is included (as built-in) with kernel versions
    starts from v2.6.34 and above, the following procedure is required to
    follow to detect MCS9865 devices.

  a) Go to the path,
        "/usr/src/kernels/linux-x.y.z/drivers/serial"
        $ cd /usr/src/kernels/linux-x.y.z/drivers/serial/

  b) Open file "8250_pci.c".
    - find for the macro PCI_DEVICE_ID_NETMOS_9865.  It will be found in two places,
        1) In the struct definition "serial_pci_tbl[]"
          - Comment the below lines,

        "
                {       PCI_VENDOR_ID_NETMOS, PCI_DEVICE_ID_NETMOS_9865,
                        0xA000, 0x1000,
                        0, 0, pbn_b0_1_115200 },

                {       PCI_VENDOR_ID_NETMOS, PCI_DEVICE_ID_NETMOS_9865,
                        0xA000, 0x3004,
                        0, 0, pbn_b0_bt_4_115200 },
        "

        2) In the routine "pci_netmos_init"
          - No need do any action, as we already done (a).

Loading the Driver:
-------------------
	
  To load the driver use the following command:
	$ insmod mcs9865.ko
	$ insmod mcs9865-isa.ko

**  '$' --this symbol represent the shell prompt on linux			

Unloading the Driver:
---------------------

  To unload the driver use the following command:
	$rmmod mcs9865
	$rmmod mcs9865-isa

**  '$' --this symbol represent the shell prompt on linux			

Installing the Driver:
----------------------
  To install the driver use the following command:
		
	make install

Uninstalling the Driver:
------------------------

  To un-install the driver use the following command:
		
	make uninstall

Note: only baud rates upto 3.0Mbps are implemented in the current driver.
	
Feature Configuration:
----------------------

  This driver comes with a static array uart_9865_contxts[ ] for all the 16 ports features in the 9865.c file.
  Where u can set the features like:
	-DMA in RX
	-DMA in TX
	-enable/disable Flow control
	-Flow control type
	-RX fifo trigger level
	-TX fifo trigger level
	-x-on character
	-x-off character

  An example array setting for PORT 0 which will be recognised as /dev/ttyD0:			

  //Port 0	--**This represents that this setting is for port 0 which will be recognised as /dev/ttyD0
  {
	.rx_dma_en	= 0,
	.tx_dma_en	= 0,
	.uart_mode	= MCS9865_RS232_MODE,
	.en_flow_control	= 0,
	.flow_ctrl_type 	= MCS9865_XON_XOFF_HW_FLOWCONTROL,
	.rxfifotrigger	= 64,
	.txfifotrigger	= 64,		
	.x_on		= SERIAL_DEF_XON,
	.x_off		= SERIAL_DEF_XOFF,
  },

	To change it to different modes like RS232 and RS422, we have to fille the .uart_mode with corresponding //UART mode defined in header files. for example for setting it to RS422 mode, we have to fill .uart_mode=MCS9865_RS422_MODE.


Kernels:
--------
  This driver is currently developed and tested on 2.6.11 linux kernel and above 	

Limitations:
------------
  This driver supports a maximum of 16 serial devices. This can be modified as required		

Steps for setting parallel port :	
---------------------------------
  1. rmmod lp
  2. rmmod parport_pc
  2. insmod /usr/lib/modules/2.6.15/kernel/drivers/parport/parport_pc io=0xb000 irq=10.

Note: Here, the io and irq should be noted from lspci -v.

Steps for setting serial isa combinatios:
-----------------------------------------
  1.Setting ISA 4 serial combination:
  ------------------------------------
	1.Go to mcs9865-isa.c file and go to the functon "struct pci_device_id".
 	2.Make comments to all other ISA combinations other than ISA 4 serial.

similarly for other ISA combinations.

PCI_SUBVEN_ID_9865_4S represents ISA 4 serial.
PCI_SUBVEN_ID_9865_3S represents ISA 3 serial.
PCI_SUBVEN_ID_9865_2S represents ISA 2 serial.
PCI_SUBVEN_ID_9865_1S represents ISA 1 serial.
PCI_SUBVEN_ID_9865_2P represents ISA 2 parallel.
PCI_SUBVEN_ID_9865_1S1P represents ISA 1 serial 1 parallel.
PCI_SUBVEN_ID_9865_2S1P represents ISA 2 serial 1 parallel.
